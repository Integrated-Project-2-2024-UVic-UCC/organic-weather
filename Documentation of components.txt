Arduino nano ble
14 I/O

The power supply will come directly from the battery, with the pins Vin and GND that supports a top of 21 V.
The converter 12V to 5V will supply the servomotor. 
It will be possible that this converter feeds the LEDs and the fiberoptic.


Outputs: 
	1 PWM servomotor control
	3 PWM for the control of the three colors of RGB LEDs termometer
	1 of tqhe fiberoptics



I2C:
	DHT22 temp and hum
	OLED Display



Inputs:
	3 analog inputs from the photoresistor
