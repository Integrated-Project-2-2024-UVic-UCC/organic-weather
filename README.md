#  ORGANIC WEATHER STATION
The "Organic Weather Station" blends botanical aesthetics with robotics, creating a responsive flower-like robot. Equipped with photodiodes, a stepper motor, and an ESP32, this design emulates the natural behavior of flower petals that open and close with changes in light levels. It demonstrates a harmonious integration of components, providing both environmental feedback and decorative value in indoor settings.

## Features
- **Adaptive Petal Movement**:  Responds to light intensity data from photodiodes, controlling the movement of its petals to mimic natural responses.
- **Environmental Feedback**: Responds to light intensity data from photodiodes, controlling the movement of its petals to mimic natural responses.
- **Remote Weather Updates**: Connects with a Telegram chat to retrieve and display weather conditions from any specified location.
- **Ambient LED Effects**: Incorporates LEDs within the petals that shift colors based on the ambient room temperature.
Because it is still in process, below you can see the layout of the plant:

## Introduction
Designed with the latest technology and high-quality components, this organic weather station will provide you with accurate and detailed information about the weather conditions in your environment. It doesn't matter if you are a weather enthusiast or just looking for a reliable tool to track the weather conditions. Intuitive features make our station easy to use and look great in any environment, whether in your home, office or even outdoors. You can have the climate
under control at all times. Everything is in one place, at your fingertips.
Change your boring and plain weather station for this new cool and amazing Organic weather that can be placed wherever you want.

Our main objective is to develop a weather station in the form of a plant that can be more appealing to the users, that receive the external inputs of the environment near the station using the sensors and use this data to interact with the mechanical parts of the plant and displaying all the information on the LCD screen to be more understandable for the user.

For the movement, we use a mechanism that consists of a worm gear that rotates by a stepper motor, attached to the worm gear are four gears, that have the petals of the plant, these ones rotate and the petals move upside down mimicking the movement of the aperture of a plant in the wild.
Here below you can see all the parts needed to be able to make this mechanism and an explanation:

GEAR ATTACHED TO THE PETALS, rotates to a certain point for the aperture and closure of the flower

WORM GEAR, on the lower end, has a dent to be able to put together the stepper motor for the rotation

HOLDER FOR THE GEARS TO MOVE WITH THE WORM GEAR, this piece holds together the center of the worm gear vertically, and in each of the four sites it goes a GEAR with a petal
